# nxlog-patterndb
A repository for a tool used to create a patterndb.xml file

## How does this work?

No clue. The intention was to create a Python script able to create
patterns for Windows Events.

The powershell script takes up the schema of the events and the rest 
of the scripts do their own thing.

You can start with `create.py` to get everything built and the `test.xml`
can be used with NXLog.
